## 🧩 Media Server Integration (Import Settings)

Within a configured media server integration you can control how Groups (VOD) and Categories (Series) are processed.

There are **two options** when it comes to genre handling:

1. Primary **Use only the first genre**. Prevents duplication by placing an item in a single group/category. **Recommended for most situations**.
2. All **Use all genres**. Items store all genres and **may appear in multiple groups/categories, which increases duplicates, storage, and sync time**.
