# Caddy vs Nginx

Choose between Nginx and Caddy for your reverse proxy setup.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Nginx | Caddy |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Configuration File** | `nginx.conf` | `Caddyfile` |
| **Config Syntax** | Complex, verbose | Simple, concise |
| **HTTPS Setup** | Manual configuration | Automatic with Let's Encrypt |
| **Container Port** | `NGINX_PORT` (default: 8080) | `CADDY_PORT` (default: 8080) |
| **SSL Certificates** | Manual management | Auto-renewal |

## When to Choose Nginx

Choose Nginx if you:

- ✅ Need maximum control and customization
- ✅ Are already familiar with nginx configuration
- ✅ Have complex routing requirements
- ✅ Want to manage SSL certificates manually
- ✅ Need specific nginx modules

## When to Choose Caddy

Choose Caddy if you:

- ✅ Want automatic HTTPS with zero configuration
- ✅ Prefer simpler, more readable configurations
- ✅ Want Let's Encrypt certificates automatically managed
- ✅ Are setting up a new deployment
- ✅ Value ease of use over maximum control

## Nginx Setup

### Starting Nginx Version

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.external-all.yml up -d
```

### Configuration File

Traditional nginx syntax with separate blocks:

```nginx
upstream m3u_editor {
    server m3u-editor:9000;
}

upstream m3u_proxy {
    server m3u-proxy:38085;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location /health {
        access_log off;
        return 200 "healthy\n";
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    }

    location / {
        fastcgi_pass m3u_editor;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

### HTTPS Configuration

Manual SSL setup required:

1. **Obtain certificates** (Let's Encrypt, commercial CA, etc.)

2. **Uncomment HTTPS server block** in `nginx.conf`

3. **Mount certificates** in docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   nginx:
     volumes:
       - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
       - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl:ro
     ports:
       - "80:80"
       - "443:443"
   ```

4. **Update nginx.conf**:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name your-domain.com;

       ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem;
       
       # ... rest of config
   }
   ```

## Caddy Setup

### Starting Caddy Version

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.external-all-caddy.yml up -d
```

### Configuration File

Simple, declarative Caddyfile syntax:

```caddyfile
{
    admin off
}

http://localhost:80 {
    @health {
        path /health
    }
    handle @health {
        respond "healthy" 200
    }

    handle_path /m3u-proxy/* {
        reverse_proxy m3u-proxy:38085
    }

    handle {
        reverse_proxy m3u-editor:9000 {
            transport fastcgi {
                root /var/www/html/public
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTPS Configuration (Automatic!)

Caddy automatically handles SSL certificates:

1. **Update your Caddyfile** with your domain:
   ```caddyfile
   https://your-domain.com {
       tls your-email@example.com
       
       # Rest of your config...
   }
   ```

2. **Update environment variables**:
   ```bash
   APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
   CADDY_SSL_PORT=443
   ```

3. **Uncomment HTTPS port** in docker-compose:
   ```yaml
   caddy:
     ports:
       - "80:80"
       - "443:443"  # Uncomment this
   ```

That's it! Caddy will automatically:
- Obtain SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt
- Renew certificates before expiration
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Handle OCSP stapling

## Configuration Syntax Examples

### Health Check Endpoint

**Nginx:**
```nginx
location /health {
    access_log off;
    return 200 "healthy\n";
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
}
```

**Caddy:**
```caddyfile
@health {
    path /health
}
handle @health {
    respond "healthy" 200
}
```

### Reverse Proxy

**Nginx:**
```nginx
location /api {
    proxy_pass http://backend:8000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

**Caddy:**
```caddyfile
handle_path /api/* {
    reverse_proxy backend:8000
}
```

## Health Checks

Both configurations include health checks:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Should return: "healthy"
```

## Environment Variables

### Nginx Setup
```bash
APP_PORT=36400
NGINX_PORT=8080
# NGINX_SSL_PORT=443  # Uncomment for HTTPS
```

### Caddy Setup
```bash
APP_PORT=36400
CADDY_PORT=8080
# CADDY_SSL_PORT=443  # Uncomment for HTTPS
```

## Performance Considerations

Both Nginx and Caddy are excellent performers for M3U Editor:

- **Nginx**: Slightly better for very high-traffic scenarios
- **Caddy**: Optimized out-of-the-box, less tuning needed

For most M3U Editor deployments, the performance difference is negligible.

## Recommendation

For new deployments, we recommend **Caddy** for its:
- Automatic HTTPS
- Simpler configuration
- Zero-touch certificate management
- Modern defaults

For existing Nginx users or complex setups, stick with **Nginx** for its:
- Maximum flexibility
- Extensive module ecosystem
- Familiar configuration
