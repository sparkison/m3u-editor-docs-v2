# Installation

Get M3U Editor up and running in minutes with Docker!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system
- Xtream codes API login info **or** M3U URLs/files containing an M3U playlist of video streams
- (Optional) EPG URLs/files containing valid XMLTV data

## Quick Start Options

M3U Editor offers several deployment options to fit your needs:

### ⭐ Recommended: Modular Deployment

**File**: `docker-compose.proxy.yml`

This setup runs separate containers for **m3u-editor**, **m3u-proxy** (external proxy required for hardware acceleration), and **Redis** — perfect for production use with granular control.

```bash
# Download the configuration
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkison/m3u-editor/main/docker-compose.proxy.yml

# Start the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d
```

**What you get**:
- M3U Editor (main application)
- M3U Proxy (streaming with hardware acceleration support)
- Redis (stream pooling and caching)
- PostgreSQL (embedded in m3u-editor)

:::tip
PostgreSQL and NGINX can be easily added as separate containers if needed!
:::

### Simple: All-in-One Deployment

**File**: `docker-compose.aio.yml`

Everything runs in a single container for quick setup and testing.

```bash
# Download the configuration
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkison/m3u-editor/main/docker-compose.aio.yml

# Start the service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.aio.yml up -d
```

:::warning
Hardware acceleration is **not supported** in the all-in-one setup.
:::

### Advanced: Modular with VPN

**File**: `docker-compose.proxy-vpn.yml`

Modular deployment with Gluetun VPN integration.

```bash
# Download the configuration
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkison/m3u-editor/main/docker-compose.proxy-vpn.yml

# Configure your VPN settings in the file
# Then start the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.proxy-vpn.yml up -d
```

## After Installation

Once your containers are running:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:36400` (or your configured port)
2. Complete the initial setup wizard
3. Add your first playlist
4. Start organizing your streams!
